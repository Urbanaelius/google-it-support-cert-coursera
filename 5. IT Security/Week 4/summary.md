# Network Hardening Best Practices
- Network hardening is securing a network by reducing vulnerabilities through configuration changes and specific steps.
- Best practices for implementing network hardening include disabling unnecessary extra services and restricting access to them.
- Implicit deny is a security principle where anything not explicitly permitted should be denied.
- Monitoring and analyzing network traffic is important to establish a baseline of normal traffic and identify potential attack traffic.
- Analyzing logs is helpful in highlighting potential intrusions, signs of malware infections, or atypical behavior.
- Log and analysis systems are best practices for IT support specialists to utilize and implement.
- Alerts are sent to alert security engineers of potential threats.
- Correlation analysis matches events across systems, and detailed logging and analysis can help determine the extent and severity of a breach.
- Splunk is a popular and powerful logs analysis system.
- Flood guards provide protection against DoS or Denial of Service Attacks, ensuring availability of the network
