# Network Hardening Best Practices
  - Network hardening is securing a network by reducing vulnerabilities through configuration changes and specific steps.
  - Best practices for implementing network hardening include disabling unnecessary extra services and restricting access to them.
  - Implicit deny is a security principle where anything not explicitly permitted should be denied.
  *Monitoring and analyzing network traffic is important to establish a baseline of normal traffic and identify potential attack traffic.
  *Analyzing logs is helpful in highlighting potential intrusions, signs of malware infections, or atypical behavior.
  *Log and analysis systems are best practices for IT support specialists to utilize and implement.
  *Alerts are sent to alert security engineers of potential threats.
  *Correlation analysis matches events across systems, and detailed logging and analysis can help determine the extent and severity of a breach.
  *Splunk is a popular and powerful logs analysis system.
  *Flood guards provide protection against DoS or Denial of Service Attacks, ensuring availability of the network.
