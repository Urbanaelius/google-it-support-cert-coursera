# Week 6: Troubleshooting

Ask great questions to understand a problem;
Isolate the problem to an effective area;
Look at the cookie crumbs in that area.

## Troubleshooting Best Practices

*"Knowing how to analyze an issue, identifying the causes and effects, and use the information to find potential solutions are skills that everyone from I.T. support specialists, to doctors can use."*

### Ask Questions!

- **Troubleshooting** is the ability to diagnose and resolve a problem.

- The first thing to do in troubleshooting is to *ask questions*.

- Never. *Never* make the user feel silly or dumb.
  - IT Support is about working in the service of others.
  - Always try to create a positive experience for the user.

### Isolating the Problem

- The *isolate the problem* method shrinks the scope of the potential issue.
  - Narrow the scope.
  - After continually isolating the problem, you arrive at the root cause.

- **Root cause:** The main factor that's causing a range of issues.


### Follow the Cookie Crumbs

- Logs are a great starting point.

- Error messages are extremely helpful indicators that can point you in the right direction.
  - Start from the first error


### Start with the Quickest First Step

- Sometimes, there are multiple options you can use to isolate something. Which tho try first?
  - Try whatever is fastest, first.


### Troubleshooting Pitfalls to Avoid

You may encounter the same issue over, and over again.

#### Going into autopilot
- Don't default to "autopilot mode"
- Don't move through issues out of habit/muscle memory, and without careful thought
- Small variables can change the problem entirely
- Ask questions and gather data, so you fully and accurately understand the problem

#### Not finding the root cause
- Don't get distracted by small problems that emerge
- There's probably a big problem causing all the small problems
- Spend a little time investigating the issue, instead of fixing small holes

*"Remember, when tasked with a problem, don't jump to conclusions. Ask questions first and gather more information. The issue be an incorrect login, a poor network connection, a server issue with the bank, or something else. Always ask questions first!"*

*"Since you've already gathered information about the problem, it's time to start figuring out what the issue is. There are two things that could be wrong: either the computer is having issues or it's the network. You can rule one out by testing whether or not someone else is able to connect to the network."*

*"Remember to ask questions in order to try to figure out what happened before the issue came up."*

*"A reboot might be required for the software to be fully installed. In this case, a reboot is also the quickest troubleshooting step to take."*



## Customer Service

*Good customer service builds brand loyalty.*

### Intro to Soft Skills

- Whenever possible, acknowledge the user
  - Provide feedback

- Empathy and acknowledgement are critical to building trust with the user

- Be honest with the user, even when you think they won't be happy about it

### Anatomy of an Interaction

1. Set a good first impression
  - Be professional, acknowledge the user, and show them respect
2. Responding to users' question
  - Integrate information into the conversation, show active listening
3. Clarify the issue before you troubleshoot
  - Don't waste the user's time
4. End on a positive note
  - The last five minutes of the interaction set the tone for how the user feels walking away from the interaction
  - Make it positive by reiterating the resolution, state the next steps, and ask for any more questions

### How to Deal with Difficult Situations

- When you identify your "reboot" action, write it down!

- Be patient!

- Break steps down into smaller, digestible points for the user

- Try to see things from other peoples' point of view

- It's easy to want to give up on a user when they're upset; but you need to put yourself in their shoes
  - They may not be thinking rationally, and may be under a significant amount of stress


## Documentation

### Ticketing Systems and Documenting Your Work

- There are two main ways of documenting information in the IT industry
  - The *ticketing* or *bug system*
  - ?

#### The Ticketing System
- **Tickets** are a common way of documenting an issue.
- **Bugs** are issues with the system that weren't caused by an external source.

- There are several IT industry-specialized systems to keep track of issues, such as:
  - [Bugzilla](https://www.bugzilla.org/)
  - [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
  - [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/)

- Update the ticket with what the issue is, the steps/procedures you're trying to resolve, and the solution you arrived at.
  - This is important for two reasons:
    1. It keeps the user in the loop;
    2. It helps audit your steps, in case you need to revisit the issue.

- But when documenting, be concise.
  - You aren't writing a story--don't be creative or cute.
  - Be technical, accurate, and let the reader quickly figure things out.

### Process Documentation

- No documentation is the *worst* documentation.

- Good documentation:
  - Starts with a clear problem;
  - It gives you background information on what the issue is;
  - And it gives you exact instructions on how to fix the issue
    - "Including which settings to navigate to and where."

### Documenting in Ticketing Systems

- You don't have to leave a full example of processed documentation for every issue you handled.
  - If you encounter the same issue, just write the documentation once, and refer back to it.

- One of the more important aspects of documentation for a ticket or bug is leaving an audit trail to see what worked and what didn't.

- An example of good documentation in a ticketing system:
Tech described what the issue is; what caused the issue; and the specific steps they took to resolve it.


## Getting Through a Technical Interview

### Standing Out from the Crowd

- Your resume is your first introduction to a new company.

- Research the company that you're applying to.

### Getting Ready for the Interview

- Pretending you're in an interview, even if it's not real, will help you perform your best.

- Articulating yourself clearly is key to nailing the interview.

- It's not about knowing the answers--you need to show your ideas clearly and concisely.

- Take some general technical subjects (DHCP, DNS, Active Directory, etc), and explain it.
  - What's it for?
  - How's it used?

- Learn to explain the same concepts in different ways.
  - This will help you adapt your answers in the actual interview.

- But you *should* memorize your elevator pitch.
  - **Elevator pitch** A short summary of who you are and what kind of career you're looking for.
  - Include your passions, how you'd like to grow, and what you're looking for in a new role.
  - Practice delivering this pitch to different people, and see how it sounds.
  - Stay flexible with it.

- The key to getting interviews right is *practice, practice, practice*.

### Creating Your Elevator Pitch

### What to Expect During the Technical Interview

- These interviews may take the form of technical troubleshooting scenarios or explanations of technical concepts and subjects.

- You need a solid foundation in all the fundamental concepts:
  - Networking
  - Operating systems
  - System administration
  - Security

- Having a good problem-solving strategy is more important than knowing all the answers.

- When you mention concepts or technologies, you should be ready to explain them and articulate why you may choose one thing over another.

- Clarify the question's constraints.
  -It's okay--and even expected--to ask the interviewer follow-up questions to ensure that the problem is correctly framed.

### Showing Your Best Self During the Interview

- Get a good night's sleep

- Eat a proper breakfast

- Be fully present for the duration of the interview.

- Don't forget to be yourself.

- Ask questions about the things that you care about.
  - Found out if this is the company you want to work for, or if you can meet your career goals there.

- Remember to slow down.
